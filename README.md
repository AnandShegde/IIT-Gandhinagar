Use the widgets to change mean and Covariance to visualize bivariate guassian for yourself.

## 2. Sampling method to draw samples from a multivariate Normal (MVN) distribution
Multivariate Gaussian Sampling.ipynb is for drawing samples from MVN distribution. It can generate Samples from MVN for any dimensions.

## 3. Implement two hidden layers neural network classifier from scratch in JAX
Implemented neural network to classify the data 
Got a test set accuray of 91.50% on the test set by training the neural network.

## 4. Bayesian Linear Regression from scratch with BlackJAX
Generated synthetic 1d linear dataset with added noise.

Used Baysian linear regression to get the distribution for the Parameters.

plotted the results.

### Steps for running the files:
All the files except Neural Network for MNIST dataset.ipynb will run directly in google colab.

For Neural Network for MNIST dataset.ipynb, extract the contents from mnist_train.csv.zip to the same directory where Neural Network for MNIST dataset.ipynb is present. and run the code.
